Welcome to Rcpp Notes!
=====================================

This project is an **unofficial** documentation of `Rcpp <http://www.rcpp.org/>`_,
an R package that provides a seamless integration of R and C++.
The document here aims to provide a function-by-function reference of the most frequently
used classes inside Rcpp, as well as some of my own understanding of this library.

The source code of this document is `hosted at Github <https://github.com/yixuan/Rcpp-note>`_.
Feedbacks and pull requests are highly appreciated.
