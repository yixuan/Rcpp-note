API Classes
=====================================

There are a number of classes defined in Rcpp that directly represent
objects in R, such as ``Vector``, ``Matrix``, ``Function`` etc.
These are classes that users are most likely to work with when writing
Rcpp code, so for clarity we may call them *API classes* of Rcpp.
