Introduction
=====================================

`Rcpp <http://www.rcpp.org/>`_ is a huge project aiming at interfacing R to C++ seamlessly.
Originally it was developed to provide an easier and more expressive API on top of R,
compared with the official R API designed for C language. Now after nearly ten years'
improvement, Rcpp has already been greatly enriched, with many useful features like Rcpp sugar,
Rcpp attributes and Rcpp modules. As for now, there are more than 200 packages on
`CRAN <http://cran.r-project.org/>`_ that directly use the functionality provided by Rcpp, and
this number is still increasing.
