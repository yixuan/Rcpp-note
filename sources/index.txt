Welcome to Rcpp Note!
=====================================

This project is an **unofficial** Rcpp API documentation guide.

`Rcpp <http://www.rcpp.org/>`_ is an R package that provides a seamless integration of R and C++,
making it easier to call C++ from R and develop R packages that rely on C++ code.
The document here aims to provide a function-by-function reference of the most commonly
used classes inside Rcpp, as well as some of my own understanding of this library.

The source code of this document is `hosted at Github <https://github.com/yixuan/Rcpp-note>`_.
Feedbacks and pull requests are highly appreciated.
