This project is an **unofficial** documentation of [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/),
an R package that provides a seamless integration of R and C++.
The document here aims to provide a function-by-function reference of the most frequently
used classes inside Rcpp, as well as some of my own understanding of this library.

This reference is written with [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/).
The generated pages are available at [http://statr.me/rcpp-note](http://statr.me/rcpp-note).
